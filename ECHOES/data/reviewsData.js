        review: "Frank speaks about his interest in pursuing the American Dream and “settling down” to start a family with two children and a swimming pool. In the lines before, he claims he’d prefer to leave the limelight of fame.",

        review: "By the time A Room With a View drops the needle, you already know Player aren’t here to just write songs — they’re building a mood. The Los Angeles soft rock outfit, best known for their breezy harmonies and sun-kissed guitar work, take a step away from the beaches and into something more cinematic.",

        year: '1970', 
        review: "Bursting out of the Canadian rock scene with unapologetic swagger, The Guess Who’s American Woman is a gutsy mix of hard rock riffs and bluesy grooves that still packs a punch decades later. The title track, with its iconic fuzzed-out guitar riff and raspy vocals from Burton Cummings, became an anthem of defiance and desire — raw, powerful, and impossible to ignore.",
